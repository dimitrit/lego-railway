### Points Servo Module

Points are switched using a custom module containing a mini servo that operates the lever of [Lego Switching Tracks](https://shop.lego.com/en-GB/Switching-Tracks-7895). 

The module consists of multiple parts to allow it to be assembled and fitted more easily.

### RFID Track

The RFID reader is held in place using a custom straight track.

### Signal

Trains are controlled using infrared emitters, which are housed together with train signals in custom 4x2 bricks.
